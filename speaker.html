            <h5>DESINING A CULTURAL OF DESIGN</h5>
            <P>Workplace culture dosen`t start the beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it dosent
                end with neckties. pcs, or big corporation. its the unwritten rules, behavior,
                beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work get to done, or its what stifles
                a workforce. for design to the mosteffective and designers to feel valued, we need to work
                in a culture that embraces design and allow it to succeed. <br>
                In Aaron`s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organization
                that *get* design, departements, and companies have that others don`t, and more importantly
                how to begin to change own Workplace culture. Once you`ve worked within a culture of design
                it`s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
            </P>

            <h5>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h5>

                allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid Prototyping
                with html, css and Javascript is wven better and faster; it increases collabration and improves the interation process.
